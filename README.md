# 🚗 UberEats_Clone

This is a clone of the Uber Eats platform, developed using a microservices architecture. It includes backend services that simulate core features of a food delivery system.

---

## 📦 Features

- Microservices architecture

---

## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine.

---

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repository

Clone the project into your local system using Git:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>  # Replace with your actual repository URL
cd UberEats_Clone
```

> **Highlight:** Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

---

### 2. 📂 Navigate to the Backend

After cloning the repository, move into the backend folder where all the microservices are located:

```bash
cd backend
```

---

### 3. 📦 Install Dependencies for Each Microservice

You’ll need to run `npm install` inside each service folder to install all required Node.js packages. Do this for each service:

```bash
cd auth-service
npm install

cd ../order-service
npm install

cd ../restaurant-service
npm install

cd ../delivery-service
npm install
```

> **Highlight:** Repeat this step for any other microservices inside the `backend` folder that are part of your project.

---

### 4. 🐳 Install Docker Desktop

This project uses Docker for containerization. Install Docker Desktop from the official website:

👉 [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Once installed, ensure Docker is running on your system.

---

### 5. 🚀 Run the Project

If your project includes a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

> **Highlight:** If you don’t have a `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start each service individually using `npm start` or the custom script defined in each microservice’s `package.json`.

For example:

```bash
cd auth-service
npm start
```

Repeat for each service.

**Highlighting Areas to Replace/Update:**
1. **Repository URL:** Replace `<your-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
2. **Backend Services:** If you have any additional microservices in your `backend/` directory, update the folder structure.
3. **Frontend Directory:** If your project includes a frontend directory (for example, React, Angular, or Vue), be sure to mention it under the project folder structure.

This should give you a clear, organized, and complete README file for your project! Let me know if you need further adjustments.
